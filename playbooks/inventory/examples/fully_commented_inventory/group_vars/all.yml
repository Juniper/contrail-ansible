# Below config params are used to configure contrailctl
# All of below variables are a dict which form individual section of
# contrailctl/*.conf (controller.conf, agent.conf, etc)
# they are just a dictionary form of config files found under contrailctl/*
# i.e below mentioned global_config is a dictionary form of [GLOBAL] section
# in contrailct/*.conf - since this is global_config, they are available to all
# config files
# where control_config is dictionary form of [CONTROL] section in
# contrailctl/controller.conf
# webui_config is dictionary form of [WEBUI] section in contrailctl/controller.conf
# for example, if one add configuration  "webui_config: {http_listen_port: 8085}"
# [WEBUI] section of contrailctl/controller.conf will be configured as below
# - which infact configure webui to listen 8085 for http
#  instead of 8080 which is default
#
# [WEBUI]
# http_listen_port = 8085

# For configuration details, please refer example configurations found in
#  https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-docker/tree/master/tools/python-contrailctl/examples/configs
#
# keystone_config: config params for keystone - these will go to [KEYSTONE] section of contrailctl/*.conf
# keystone_config: {}

# *** NOTE: Individual service/group commented configurations are kept in individual group based yaml files *** #
# (e.g contrail-controller.yml for controller), - this is just to avoid one huge file, but all _config variables can be
# kept in all.yml itself if needed. i.e one can just combine all files found in group_vars/ in this example into one yml
# file named as all.yml
