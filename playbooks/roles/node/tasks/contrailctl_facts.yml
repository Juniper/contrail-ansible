# Simulate what contrailctl does for container to baremetal
# it create facts
# for global_config and agent_config it write same variable -
#   in fact for any <container_role_name>_config are treated as
#   global_config for that component
# For others, write variable in form <component>_<variable name> - i,e
# for keystone_config={ip: 192.168.0.11}, variable name will be "keystone_ip"

# NOTE: this code only support very minimal logic that contrailctl
# use to add ansible vars

#
# This will set facts only for global vars and any <container_role_name>
# vars - container_role_names are controller, agent, analytics, analyticsdb,etc
# Used with_inidata just to make the code more readable, especially if you need
# to pass more dicts, it is more readable if you specify as multiple dicts rather
# than use combine() to combine all dicts together
